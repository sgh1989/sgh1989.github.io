							<p>I had a significant motivation to study Computer Engineering, I entered to Islamic Azad University which
is well-known and according to QS website, the rank of Islamic Azad University is between 351-400. I
always tried my best during my education at university; hence, I was an active student in the classroom and
Computer Club in our faculty. For example, I tried to teach lessons in which I excelled to a group of students
who had difficulties, or I held different programs related to computer with other members of the faculty.
Among all of courses that I studied, I focused on the programming languages (C++, PHP, and Python),
Algorithm Design (16 out of 20), Database (18.5 out of 20), operating systems (14.5 out of 20), artificial
intelligence (19 out of 20), Network (17.5 out of 20), and Assembly Language Programing (16.75 out of
20) to enhance my skills in this field because they play an important role in any fields related to computer.
This allowed me to develop problem-solving abilities and a deep understanding of key programming
concepts.
For my final bachelor’s project, I designed a website for a university using PHP, which was my first
experience. The site allows students to register, check grades, courses and manage them. Also, faculty could
update course information and manage student progress. I faced challenges such as file management, which
addressed by introducing file storage organization and limiting upload sizes to enhance efficiency. Theproject was successful and as a result, I earned full marks 20 out of 20 and my academic performance placed
me among the top 10 undergraduate students in my faculty, with a score of 16.99 out of 20.</p>

							<p> After graduating in 2013 and building on the technological basis from my academic work, I aimed to further
my experience. I concentrated on deepening my understanding of computer networks during my study
break, and I obtained useful practical experience by earning certifications and working in the industry. I
earned certificates in MCITP (Microsoft Certified IT Professional), CCNA (Cisco Certified Network
Associate), and CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) courses from 2013 to 2015. My practical
experience in network has given me a deep understanding of the infrastructure that supports ICT systems.
These useful insights have given me the confidence to take on increasingly complex ICT subjects, such as
network security, cloud computing, and data communication, which are essential components of the field.
Currently, I work part-time as a Senior Network specialist at Sapa and other companies. My responsibilities
include software installation, systems and networks monitoring to identify and resolve issues, training other
staff, analyzing customers' networks, systems, and websites. A significant project was my internship at the
International Hotel in Tehran, where I activated servers, switches, and IPTVs, set IPs, and resolved
connectivity issues. These study and work experiences have honed my technical skills, teamwork, time
management, responsibility, problem-solving, Communication, and improved my critical thinking skills,
and prepared me for advanced studies.
During the past four years, I voluntarily participated in several charity events, which allowed me to connect
with individuals from diverse backgrounds and enhance my communication skills. I also took the
opportunity to enhance my language skills by enrolling in advanced English courses </p>
