							<p>I had a significant motivation to study Computer Engineering, I entered to Islamic Azad University which
is well-known and according to QS website, the rank of Islamic Azad University is between 351-400. I
always tried my best during my education at university; hence, I was an active student in the classroom and
Computer Club in our faculty. For example, I tried to teach lessons in which I excelled to a group of students
who had difficulties, or I held different programs related to computer with other members of the faculty.
Among all of courses that I studied, I focused on the programming languages (C++, PHP, and Python),
Algorithm Design (16 out of 20), Database (18.5 out of 20), operating systems (14.5 out of 20), artificial
intelligence (19 out of 20), Network (17.5 out of 20), and Assembly Language Programing (16.75 out of
20) to enhance my skills in this field because they play an important role in any fields related to computer.
This allowed me to develop problem-solving abilities and a deep understanding of key programming
concepts.
For my final bachelor’s project, I designed a website for a university using PHP, which was my first
experience. The site allows students to register, check grades, courses and manage them. Also, faculty could
update course information and manage student progress. I faced challenges such as file management, which
addressed by introducing file storage organization and limiting upload sizes to enhance efficiency. Theproject was successful and as a result, I earned full marks 20 out of 20 and my academic performance placed
me among the top 10 undergraduate students in my faculty, with a score of 16.99 out of 20.</p>
