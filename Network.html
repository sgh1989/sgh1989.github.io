        <h1 class="major">Network Specialist</h1>
        <p>After graduating in 2013 and building on the technological basis from my academic work, I aimed to further
my experience. I concentrated on deepening my understanding of computer networks during my study break, 
and I obtained useful practical experience by earning certifications and working in the industry. I
earned certificates in MCITP (Microsoft Certified IT Professional), CCNA (Cisco Certified Network
Associate), and CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) courses from 2013 to 2015. My practical
experience in network has given me a deep understanding of the infrastructure that supports ICT systems.
These useful insights have given me the confidence to take on increasingly complex ICT subjects, such as
network security, cloud computing, and data communication, which are essential components of the field.
Currently, I work part-time as a Senior Network specialist at Sapa and other companies. My responsibilities
include software installation, systems and networks monitoring to identify and resolve issues, training other
staff, analyzing customers' networks, systems, and websites. A significant project was my internship at the
International Hotel in Tehran, where I activated servers, switches, and IPTVs, set IPs, and resolved
connectivity issues. These study and work experiences have honed my technical skills, teamwork, time
management, responsibility, problem-solving, Communication, and improved my critical thinking skills,
and prepared me for advanced studies.
During the past four years, I voluntarily participated in several charity events, which allowed me to connect
with individuals from diverse backgrounds and enhance my communication skills. I also took the
opportunity to enhance my language skills by enrolling in advanced English courses</p>
